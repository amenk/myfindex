MyFindex makes it possible to import any type of media (Harddrives, CDs, DVDs, USB Sticks...). It then is possible to search
files and content with its powerful searchfunction, even if the media is not inserted.

If the file was found, it can be opened directly within MyFindex, with all the power of a real filebrowser. If needed, MyFindex asks
for insertion of the media.

There are reasonable functions even for powerusers. For example, it is possible to enter a search term with options into the adress bar,
and the options while importing can be saved for later usage. 

For every file, folder and media,  information and notes can be archived. This information can be shown selective in the notesfield or as
an extra column.
